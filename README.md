# Don't try this at home

None of this code works. It is full of hard-coded filenames. Nothing is really
documented. It is a hodgepodge of languages. No structure. But ... it does (or
did) some really cool stuff.

I'll just need to sort through it, track down some sample files, and make some
magic.
